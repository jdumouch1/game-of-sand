## Simulation:
- Friction
- Fix settling
- Cell Interation
- Inter-chunk simulation
- Dynamic chunk generation (on the fly)
- Multithreading

## Usability:
- Get correct mouse position, and chunk at that location
- Brush visualization

## Rendering
- Chunk swapping
- Render modes
- Create debug renderer
- Linear algebra (expand)

## Longshots
- Post-processing
- Offload simulation to GPU
